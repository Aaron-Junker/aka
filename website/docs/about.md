# ☀️ About akaSearch

AkaSearch is a crowd sourced database of Microsoft's aka.ms links. AkaSearch is not an official Microsoft product or service. If you like shortcuts check out '[cmd.ms](https://cmd.ms) the Microsoft Cloud command line!'.

## 🔗 What is aka.ms?

aka.ms is Microsoft's url shortening service that is available to Microsoft employees to create short urls in the format [aka.ms/**shortname**](#). These links are used in documentation, presentations, and other places to make it easier to share links.

## 💡 Why akaSearch?

While there are curated lists of aka.ms links like [Dynamics 365 aka.ms links](https://learn.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/readiness/readiness-bcall) there is no central place where one can go to find a list of aka.ms links. This is where akaSearch comes in.
